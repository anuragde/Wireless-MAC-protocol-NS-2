The main goal of the project is to implement and evaluate a wireless MAC (Medium Access Control) protocol for sensor networks using network simulator (NS-2).For this, I have made changes to the simple MAC protocol provided in the NS-2 package by default.

The changes made to the code are present in the patch file.
